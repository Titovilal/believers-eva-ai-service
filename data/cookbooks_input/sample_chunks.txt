## Anatomy of the Somatosensory System

FROM WIKIBOOKS 1

Our somatosensory system consists of sensors in the skin and sensors in our muscles, tendons, and joints. The receptors in the skin, the so called cutaneous receptors, tell us about temperature ( thermoreceptors ), pressure and surface  texture  ( mechano  receptors ),  and  pain  ( nociceptors ). The receptors in muscles and joints provide information about muscle length, muscle tension, and joint angles.

## Cutaneous receptors

Sensory information from Meissner corpuscles and rapidly adapting afferents leads to adjustment of grip force when objects  are  lifted.  These  afferents  respond  with  a  brief burst of action potentials when objects move a small distance  during  the  early  stages  of  lifting.  In  response  to

Figure  1: Receptors  in  the  human skin: Mechanoreceptors can be free receptors or encapsulated. Examples  for  free  receptors  are the hair receptors at the roots of hairs. Encapsulated receptors are the  Pacinian  corpuscles  and  the receptors  in  the  glabrous  (hairless)  skin:  Meissner  corpuscles, Ruffini  corpuscles  and  Merkel's disks.

The image illustrates the structure and function of a muscle spindle within a muscle, including the interaction between intrafusal muscle fibers and nerve innervations. It shows the pathways of afferent (Ia and II) and efferent (γ-s and γ-d motoneuron) neurons connecting to the central nervous system. The diagram highlights the role of extrafusal muscle fascicles in the movement of a limb.

rapidly adapting afferent activity, muscle force increases reflexively until the gripped object no longer moves. Such a rapid response to a tactile stimulus is a clear indication of the role played by somatosensory neurons in motor activity.

The slowly adapting Merkel's receptors are responsible for form and texture perception. As would be expected for receptors  mediating  form  perception,  Merkel's  receptors are present at high density in the digits and around the mouth (50/mm² of skin surface), at lower density in other glabrous surfaces, and at very low density in hairy skin. This  innervations  density  shrinks  progressively  with  the passage of time so that by the age of 50, the density in human digits is reduced to 10/mm². Unlike rapidly adapting axons, slowly adapting fibers respond not only to the initial indentation of skin, but also to sustained indentation up to several seconds in duration.

Activation of the rapidly adapting Pacinian corpuscles gives  a  feeling  of  vibration,  while  the  slowly  adapting Ruffini  corpuscles respond  to  the  lataral  movement  or stretching of skin.

## Nociceptors

Nociceptors  have  free  nerve  endings.  Functionally,  skin nociceptors  are  either  high-threshold  mechanoreceptors or polymodal receptors .  Polymodal receptors respond not

only to intense mechanical stimuli, but also to heat and to noxious chemicals. These receptors respond to minute punctures of the epithelium, with a response magnitude that depends on the degree of tissue deformation. They also respond to temperatures in the range of 40-60°C, and change their response rates as a linear function of warming (in contrast with the saturating responses displayed by non-noxious thermoreceptors at high temperatures).

Pain signals can be separated into individual components,  corresponding  to  different  types  of  nerve  fibers used for transmitting these signals. The rapidly transmitted  signal,  which  often  has  high  spatial  resolution,  is called first pain or cutaneous pricking pain . It is well localized and easily tolerated. The much slower, highly affective component is called second pain or burning pain ; it is poorly  localized  and  poorly  tolerated.  The  third  or deep pain , arising from viscera, musculature and joints, is also poorly  localized,  can  be  chronic  and  is  often  associated with referred pain.

## Muscle Spindles

================================================================================
CHUNK 12
================================================================================
Scattered throughout virtually every striated muscle in the body are long, thin, stretch receptors called muscle spindles. They are quite simple in principle, consisting of a few small muscle fibers with a capsule surrounding the middle third of the fibers. These fibers are called intrafusal fibers , in contrast to the ordinary extrafusal fibers . The ends of the intrafusal fibers are attached to extrafusal fibers, so whenever the muscle is stretched, the intrafusal fibers are also stretched. The central region of each intrafusal fiber has

The diagram illustrates the neuromuscular control system, showcasing the interactions between interneurons, muscle fibers, and sensory receptors. It includes pathways for force and length feedback from Golgi tendon organs and muscle spindles to control muscle activity. The system involves alpha and gamma motor neurons, influencing muscle contraction and spindle sensitivity, respectively.

Muscle spindles also receive a motor innervation. The large motor neurons that supply extrafusal muscle fibers are called alpha motor neurons , while the smaller ones supplying  the  contractile  portions  of  intrafusal  fibers  are called gamma neurons .  Gamma motor neurons can regulate the sensitivity of the muscle spindle so that this sensitivity can be maintained at any given muscle length.

## Joint receptors

The joint  receptors  are  low-threshold  mechanoreceptors and have been divided into four groups. They signal different characteristics of joint function (position, movements, direction and speed of movements). The free receptors or type 4 joint receptors are nociceptors.
